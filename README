= yahoo-geoplanet

A Ruby wrapper for the Yahoo! GeoPlanet APIs.

== Example Usage

=== Searching for a Location:

  require 'yahoo-geoplanet'
  include Yahoo::GeoPlanet
  Yahoo::GeoPlanet.app_id = [Your App ID Here]
  
  # Returns first 20 results by default
  Place.search("Springfield")
  
  # ...but let's say you want _all_ of them
  Place.search("Springfield", :count => 0) # Returns all 110
  
  # You can pass in any Matrix or Query parameters this way too
  # For more details see the following URLs:
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#matrix_parameters
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#query_parameters
  
=== Initializing by Where On Earth ID && Associations
  
  require 'yahoo-geoplanet'
  include Yahoo::GeoPlanet
  Yahoo::GeoPlanet.app_id = [Your App ID Here]
  
  cmu = Place.new(23511275) # WoE ID for Carnegie Mellon University
  
  # Everything you get back from the API you have direct access to
  # through the Place object. For example:
  
  puts cmu.type           # "Point of Interest"
  puts cmu.county         # "Allegheny"
  puts cmu.latitude       # 40.444
                          # Latitude and Longitude are values at Centroid
  puts cmu.bounding_box   # [[40.44445, -79.943314], [40.44355, -79.944511]]
                          # Bounding box are NW / SE coordinates in array
  
  # We unlock the true power of GeoPlanet with association collections
  # Check out this truly amazing stuff:
  
  # The containing GeoPlanet entity for CMU
  puts cmu.parent # "Squirrel Hill North"
  
  # A list of other points of interest in the area
  cmu.siblings.each{|s| puts s} 
  
  # A complete hierarchy, from country down to suburb
  cmu.ancestors.each{|s| puts s}
